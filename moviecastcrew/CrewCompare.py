#a TypeError where the 'Person' object isn't callable. And both of the lists
#are filled with 'Person' objects. SO I may have to edit the big ugly lines of
#if statements. Or find some other crafty way of extracting the strings of 
#names from the person objects (preferably while they're already in the lists
#I've made so I didn't waste my time with these big ugly if-statements!).
